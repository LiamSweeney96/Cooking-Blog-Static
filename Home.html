                    <h3>Where to find the ingredients?</h3>            
                    
                    <p>
                        In the dishes on this website, you will find that most of the ingredients are easy to come by. However, in certain cases, the ingredients are quite rare. For example, galangal for the Tom Kha can be quite ticky to get ahold of. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best places to look are supermarkets, but failing that you may need to find more specialised shops based around a particular cuisine. The dishes are definitely worth the effort though!

                    <h3>The Cost</h3>

                    <p>
                        The best thing about the dishes on this website? They're easy and cheap to make! The highest cost the will come from one of the dishes would be around Â£5, but once you taste it you know it's worth the money!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to take the dishes a step further, you could even buy higher quality ingredients to get a better depth of flavour! This is a good idea if you are cooking for a special occasion.
