				<p>Below, I will detail the ingredients and method for making my take on Tom Kha Gai. I removed the Coconut Milk to give it a thinner, less creamy consistency but this is entirely based on preference. Most ingredients will be available at your local supermarket, however, some may be difficult to find.</p>

					<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

					<h2> Method:</h2>

					<ul>
					<li><b>1.</b> Grind up the Chilli, Galangal, and Garlic using a pestle & mortar until it forms a paste. Set this to one side. Chop the Lemongrass stalks into threes, then, using the back of a knife, lightly crush the pieces to release the oils.</li>
					<li><b>2.</b> Heat up the Coconut Oil on medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer. When the oil has reached this stage, add the Lemongrass.</li>
					<li><b>3.</b> Once the Lemongrass has become fragrant (around 3 minutes), add the chilli paste you made earlier and cook out for another 3 minutes making sure to stir occasionally.</li>
					<li><b>4.</b> Next, add the chicken and fry off for 2 minutes or until the sides are sealed.</li>
					<li><b>5.</b> Then, add the vegetable stock, lime leaves, soy sauce, and tomatoes. Stir to combine and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover with a lid and lower the heat. Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
					<li><b>6.</b> After this, add the mushrooms and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
					<li><b>7.</b> Then, add the honey and lime juice, and add salt to taste.</li>
					<li><b>8.</b> Finally, add Coriander leaves as a garnish and serve.</li>


					</ul>

						<h2>The Finished Dish</h2>

						<p>Below, is a picture of my finished Tom Kha. As you can see, my version is quite a clear soup. Not using coconut milk allowed for this thinner consistency which I chose due simply to preference. The lime leaves especially add a huge flavour and fragrance to this dish, making it a very pleasant experience to cook as well as to eat. I would highly recommend this dish due simply to it's bold flavours.</p>
